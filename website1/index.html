    <h1>
        Cats
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">For a long time, it was a widely held belief that cats <strong> originated in Egypt
        </strong> some
        4,000 years ago.
        cat is a small animal that belongs to the <strong> “Felidae” </strong> family.They are playful and
        spending time with them reduces
        stress and anxiety.</p>

    <center><p style="text-align:centre;font-size: 20px;">When my cat starts acting differently in any way, you can find me
        googling the problem followed by the term
        "Reddit".
        Like,"<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/catcare/comments/h8n09t/why_has_my_cat_stopped_covering_her_poop/">cat
            not
            covering poop reddit</a>"(he doesn't feel threatened as the alpha in my home) or "<a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/rv4p9z/any_reason_why_my_cat_just_stares_at_me_like_this/">cat
            staring at me while I work and looks so mad reddit</a>" (it's just an extension of his general attitude
        problem).
        There's also boards that are a bit more serious, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/">r/AskVet</a> ,
        for when you need to know what to do after
        catching your cat eating something he shouldn't, or pulling them off of a stray cat.</p></center>
